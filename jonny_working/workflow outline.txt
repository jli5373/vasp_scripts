List of SCEL+configs of interest (txt) - by CASM project
by line
ex. for HCP 1 txt file
SCEL1_1_1_0_0_0/1/
SCEL1_1_1_0_2_0/0/

ex. for FCC another txt file
SCEL4_1_etc/0
SCEL
SCEL
SCEL..././

templates all in a single directory

assuming starting from: ran relaxation->static on every config and already picked ground states - make sure statics for future already calculate PDOS
we want: band struct/charge diff/parchg (require E ranges)/rerun relax->static w spinpol

template INCAR/other inputs for the scenarios (every should have template)

-------------------------------------------------------

ex. spinpol
in main folder: SCEL_list, python script to setup folders (which has header inputs)
../templates/INCAR_relax_spinpolarized_template

Individual scripts/functions based on scenario

for spin pol:
Inputs: SCEL List, INCAR_relax_spinpolarized_template, directory_of_vasp_runs, parent_directory
if(directory_of_vasp_runs)
    cp POSCAR, POTCAR, KPOINTS (mapping to that will require walk, make sure statics use run.final as folder) from those runs to new folders
    print: copied from xyz

elseif(new)
    will have been done in CASM
elseif(random POSCAR)
    POSCAR -> generate POTCAR
    have KPOINTS density & ENCUT as inputs
    cp INCAR_relax_spinpolarized_template and format

generate submit scripts that go in same spot as input INCAR
qsub submit script (this way commenting anything in the SCEL list doesnt rerun it)
